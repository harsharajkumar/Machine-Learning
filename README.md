# Machine Learning From Scratch
This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch, without relying on libraries like scikit-learn. The primary goal is to provide a clear understanding of the underlying mechanics of each algorithm.

# Algorithms Implemented
Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Descent

Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

And more to come...

# Features
No external libraries: Implementations rely solely on NumPy for numerical computations.

Step-by-step explanations: Code is well-commented to facilitate learning.

Modular design: Each algorithm is implemented as a separate class for easy use and understanding.

Example usage: Each algorithm implementation includes example usage.

# Getting Started

To use these implementations, you only need Python and NumPy.
``` python
pip install numpy
```

# Contributions
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute an implementation of a new algorithm or improve an existing one, feel free to submit a pull request.

Purpose
This repository is intended for educational purposes. It's a great resource for:

Students learning machine learning

Developers who want to understand how machine learning algorithms work internally

Anyone who wants to implement machine learning algorithms from scratch
