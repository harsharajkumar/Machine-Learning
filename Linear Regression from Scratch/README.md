# Linear Regression Implementation in NumPy

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Linear Regression algorithm using only the NumPy library. It's designed to be a simple and understandable way to learn the fundamentals of linear regression from scratch.

## Overview

This implementation covers the core aspects of linear regression:

- **Initialization:** Setting up the learning rate, number of iterations, and initial weights and bias.
- **Fitting:** Training the model using the gradient descent optimization algorithm to find the optimal weights and bias that minimize the difference between predicted and actual values.
- **Prediction:** Using the learned weights and bias to make predictions on new data.

## Getting Started

To use this implementation, you'll need Python and the NumPy library installed.

```bash
pip install numpy
Usage
Here's a basic example of how to use the LinearRegression class:

Python

import numpy as np
from linear_regression import LinearRegression  # Assuming you saved the code as linear_regression.py
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Generate some sample data
np.random.seed(42)
X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 4 + 3 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=1234)

# Initialize the Linear Regression model
model = LinearRegression(lr=0.01, n_iters=1000)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error: {mse}")

# Print the learned parameters
print(f"Weight (w): {model.weight}")
print(f"Bias (b): {model.bias}")
Note: Make sure to save the provided Python code in a file named linear_regression.py in the same directory where you run the example script.

Class Definition
Python

    def __init__(self, lr=0.001, n_iters=1000):
        """
        Initializes the Linear Regression model.

        Args:
            lr (float, optional): The learning rate for gradient descent. Defaults to 0.001.
            n_iters (int, optional): The number of iterations for gradient descent. Defaults to 1000.

        Args:
            X (numpy.ndarray): The input features (n_samples, n_features).
            y (numpy.ndarray): The target values (n_samples,).

        n_samples, n_features = X.shape

            dw = (1 / n_samples) * np.dot(X.T, (y_pred - y))
            db = (1 / n_samples) * np.sum(y_pred - y)

            self.weight -= self.lr * dw
            self.bias -= self.lr * db

    def predict(self, X):
        """
        Predicts values for new data points.

        Args:
            X (numpy.ndarray): The input features (n_samples, n_features).

        Returns:
            numpy.ndarray: The predicted values (n_samples,).
        """
        return np.dot(X, self.weight) + self.bias
Key Concepts
Gradient Descent: An iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. In this context, it's used to minimize the cost function (e.g., Mean Squared Error) by adjusting the weights and bias.
Learning Rate (lr): Controls the step size at each iteration of gradient descent. A smaller learning rate might lead to more accurate results but could take longer to converge. A larger learning rate might converge faster but could overshoot the optimal values.
Number of Iterations (n_iters): The number of times the gradient descent algorithm iterates through the training data to update the weights and bias.
Weights (weight): Coefficients that multiply the input features. They represent the influence of each feature on the predicted output.
Bias (bias): An intercept term that represents the value of the prediction when all input features are zero.
